# Policy Solution Search & Summarization Flow

1. Extract and Clean Article Texts
   - Collect article texts from WET files for target domains and 2021.
   - Clean and preprocess the text (remove HTML, normalize whitespace, etc.).

2. Summarize Each Article
   - Use an NLP summarization tool (extractive or abstractive) to generate a concise summary for each article.

3. Generate Embeddings for Semantic Search
   - Use a sentence embedding model (e.g., SBERT) to convert each summary into a vector.

4. Build a Semantic Search Index
   - Index all summary embeddings for fast similarity search.

5. User Query Workflow
   - User enters a keyword or phrase (e.g., "lockdown").
   - Convert the query to an embedding.
   - Retrieve the most semantically similar article summaries from the index.
   - Display summaries and highlight outcome-related sentences (e.g., mentions of effectiveness, success, or failure).

6. (Optional) Keyword Frequency & Context Extraction
   - Provide a word frequency index for general overview.
   - Allow users to view context sentences for specific keywords if needed.

7. Transform Data into Outcomes
   - Identify and extract sentences describing policy results (e.g., "lockdown reduced cases").
   - Aggregate and count outcome mentions by policy, country, or time period.
   - Summarize and visualize which measures were most often associated with positive or negative outcomes.
   - Report findings to inform policy decisions or further research.
