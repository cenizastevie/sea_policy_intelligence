You can absolutely enable users to search for solutions or outcomes related to a keyword (like “lockdown”) using NLP. Here’s how you can design such a system:

1. Indexing:
 - Build a word frequency index for fast keyword lookup.  - Index articles by keywords they contain.

2. User Search:
 - When a user enters a keyword (e.g., “lockdown”), retrieve all articles containing that keyword.

3. Context & Solution Extraction:
 - For each article, extract the context (sentence/paragraph) where the keyword appears.  - Use NLP or pattern matching to find sentences mentioning outcomes or solutions (e.g., “lockdown was effective”, “lockdown failed”, “lockdown reduced cases”).

4. Present Results:
 - Show users the relevant article excerpts and highlight the solution or outcome related to their keyword.

This is achievable with:

Python (with libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or even just regex for simple cases)
A simple web or command-line interface for user input and results display

Semantic Search / Embeddings:

Convert both your keyword (e.g., “lockdown”) and article summaries into vector representations (embeddings) using models like Sentence Transformers (e.g., SBERT).
Find articles whose summaries are semantically similar to your keyword or query, even if they use different words (e.g., “movement restrictions”, “stay-at-home order”).
Topic Modeling:

Use algorithms like LDA or NMF to group articles by topics. Searching for a keyword will return articles from related topics, not just those with the exact word.
Synonym & Concept Expansion:

Expand your search to include synonyms and related phrases using resources like WordNet or pre-built synonym lists.
